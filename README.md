# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

Analysis was performed on close to 4000 Kickstarter data with tools such as the Box and Whiskers graph, descriptive statistics and other tools in order to analyze what makes a successful or an unsuccesful campaign. This analysis was built to help Louise and her future Kickstarter campaign. Here are a few graphs that show the key take-aways from our analysis:

* ![Descriptive statistics of Kickstarter plays in the U.S.](C:\Users\zzyzz\Desktop\school 2020\US plays descriptive statistics.png)---This shows that failed campaigns have higher pledge goals that succesful ones and receive less pedges

* ![Box and Whiskers chart of Kickstarter musicals in Great Britain](C:\Users\zzyzz\Desktop\school 2020\box and whiskers.png)---This shows that musical Kickstarters in Great Britain have the tendency of having too high of a pledge goal compared to the amount pledged.

My main recommendation to Louise is therefore to not lower the ledge goal as it increases the chances of the pledge being successful.
